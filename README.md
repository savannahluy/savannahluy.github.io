## Welcome!
#### I strive to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript in the form of a Personal Portfolio Website!

## Release Updates:
#### v1: Begin with general site structure; Add carousel, create sections, page bookmarks, and collapsible text boxes.

## Upcoming Features:
#### In the next version, I hope to update my carousel slides and populate my site with more information! 

###### This website is a work in progress. Thank you for visiting my site and for your patience as I continue to develop my site! Can't wait to share more, stay tuned!
